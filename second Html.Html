    <p>
The canteen at my school, Valley Grove Secondary (VGS), boasted the most impressive layout in the entire region. It was a spacious, two-story haven where students and staff alike could enjoy their meals and socialize in style. The design was carefully thought out to offer a dynamic experience - a place where you could both "see and be seen" or find a quiet nook for a moment of solitude..
